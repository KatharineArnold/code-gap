# code-gap

## Concept
The concept of Code Gap is bridging the gap between Software Developers hungry for experience and organizations in need of skilled volunteers.

## Results
Using Node.js, Handlebars, Express and Sequelize I was able to develop an app that allows users to create a profile on Code Gap as well as view projects, and allows organizations to create a profile, add projects and view volunteers.
